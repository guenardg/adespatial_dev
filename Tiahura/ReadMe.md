Decription of the Tiahura transect fish data set.

4) Habitat(22x10): 22 sites (rows) x 10 environmental variables (columns):

_distance_ from the beach (m)
water _depth) (cm)
stone _slab_
_sand_
coral _debris_
_turf_ and dead coral
live _coral_
large _algae_
_calcareous_ algae
_other_ substrate: large echinoderms (holothuroids and sea stars), sponges, 
     anemones, alcyonarians

Details:
Habitat variables 3 - 10 were percentage coverage indices of the reef bottom by
different materials, based on 50 observation points. Along a 50-m rope, 50
observations were made at 1 m intervals; the following variables report what
proportion of the 50 readings pertain to each category of substrate.

Several of these categories represent biological material lying on top of, 
intermingled with, or attached to the mineral substrate. When the 22 stations 
are considered globally, these eight categories of substrate respectively 
represent 2.5%, 31.1%, 11.4%, 14.3%, 13.9%, 18.7%, 7.5%, and 0.7% of the 
observed points.

This data set was made available to the students in the European Advanced Course 
"Numerical Analysis in Marine Ecology", Villefranche-sur-Mer, 3 - 20 July 1996.
