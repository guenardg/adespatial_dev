Decription of the Tiahura transect fish data set.

This data set contains 3 files. Data on a line are separated by blanks.

1) Fish(280x22):   280 species (rows) x 22 sites (columns).
   The names of the fish species are found in file "280 species names".

2) Behav(280x5):   280 species (rows) x 5 behavioral and biological var. (columns):
   
Variable 1: Feeding habits (nominal)
	1 = herbivorous (n = 43)
	2 = omnivorous (n = 43)
	3 = diurnal grazer on sessile invertebrates: corals, alcyonarians, sponges, 
	    etc. (n = 25)
	4 = carnivorous type 1 (diurnal): small crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, 
	    and polychaetes (n = 66)
	5 = carnivorous type 2 (nocturnal): large crustaceans (crabs), cephalopods, 
	    fish (n = 58)
	6 = fish eater (fish-only diet) (n = 16)
	7 = zooplankton-eater (copepods) (n = 29)
Variable 2: Ecological category (nominal)
	1 = hiding in holes, cavities, etc. (n = 58)
	2 = living on the bottom (often poor swimmers) (n = 23)
	3 = circling small territories around coral heads (n = 91)
	4 = swimming above the coral heads; larger vital neighbourhoods (n = 81)
	5 = good swimmers, covering large distances on the reef (n = 8)
	6 = sub-surface species (n = 11)
	7 = pelagic species (n = 8)
Variable 3: Size class of adults (ordinal)
	1 = 0 - 15 cm (n = 81)
	2 = 16 - 30 cm (n = 73)
	3 = 31 - 60 cm (n = 83)
	4 = 61 - 120 cm (n = 33)
	5 = 121 - 240 cm (n = 9)
	6 = larger than 240 cm (n = 1)
Variable 4: Egg type (nominal)
	1 = pelagic eggs (n = 192)
	2 = benthic eggs (n = 86)
	3 = viviparous species (n = 2)
Variable 5: Activity rhythm (nominal)
	1 = diurnal (n = 196)
	2 = nocturnal (n = 38)
	3 = indifferent (n = 46)

3) Habitat(10x22): 10 environmental variables (rows) x 22 sites (columns):

3.1  distance (m) from the beach and 
3.2  water depth (cm). 

The other measured habitat variables were percentage coverage indices of the 
reef bottom by different materials, based on 50 observation points. Along a 
50-m rope, 50 observations were made at 1 m intervals; the following variables 
report what proportion of the 50 readings pertain to each category of substrate: 

3.3  stone slab
3.4  sand
3.5  coral debris
3.6  turf and dead coral
3.7  live coral
3.8  large algae
3.9  calcareous algae
3.10 other substrate: large echinoderms (holothuroids and sea stars), sponges, 
     anemones, alcyonarians

Several of these categories represent biological material lying on top of, 
intermingled with, or attached to the mineral substrate. When the 22 stations 
are considered globally, these eight categories of substrate respectively 
represent 2.5%, 31.1%, 11.4%, 14.3%, 13.9%, 18.7%, 7.5%, and 0.7% of the 
observed points.

This data set was made available to the students in the European Advanced Course 
"Numerical Analysis in Marine Ecology", Villefranche-sur-Mer, 3 - 20 July 1996.
